# 20241203_survival_project
This project focuses on analyzing survival data from real-world applications, specifically examining heart failure disease. The objective is to conduct a survival analysis using different models to understand the impact of various clinical and demographic factors on patient survival. By analyzing heart failure clinical records, we aim to identify key predictors of survival time, assess their significance, and evaluate the relative risk associated with each variable. Ultimately, this analysis will provide insights into factors that may influence patient outcomes, aiding in clinical decision-making for heart failure management.
